This repository contains both assignments for the COMP2000 module:
<ul>
<li>Assignment 1 - https://github.com/Plymouth-University/comp2000-main-assignment-ORG4N/tree/main/Assignment%201</li>
<li>Assignment 2 - https://github.com/Plymouth-University/comp2000-main-assignment-ORG4N/tree/main/Assignment%202/ProjectApp</li>
</ul>

## Assignment 2
An app has been developed to interact with an API (https://github.com/shirleyatkinson/COMP2000API) that is used to show students the projects that they are allocated to.
Through this app students can also create new projects as well as delete or update existing ones.

The app has been developed in Java and uses the Volley (https://developer.android.com/training/volley) to perform GET/PUT/POST/DELETE requests.
